This is an example for using the Python binding PyMuPDF for MuPDF.

The program extracts the text of any supported input document and writes it
to a text file.
The input file name is provided as a parameter to this script (sys.argv[1])
The output file name is input-filename + ".txt".

In an effort to ensure correct reading sequence, text blocks are sorted in
ascending vertical, then horizontal direction. Sorting happens based on the
coordinates of the blocks' top-left rectangle corner.
This should work for text in horizontal, top-left to bottom-right writing mode.
Please make adjustments to your case as appropriate.

Changes
-------
2021-06-29: simplify block sorting and make script importable.
