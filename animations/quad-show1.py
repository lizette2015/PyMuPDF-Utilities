Purpose
--------
Visualize function "drawOval" by using a quadrilateral (tetrapod) as parameter.

For demonstration purposes, text box creation is placed in a function, which
accepts the desired parameter as float value. This value controls positioning
some egdes of the quad.
It then creates a dummy temporary PDF with one page, containing stuff we want
to show and returns an image of it.

The function is called by the main program in an "endless" loop, passing in
float values. The image is displayed using PySimpleGUI.

Notes
------
* Changed generated page image format to "PPM", which is very much faster than
  "PNG" both, in terms of creation and reading by tkinter. It also makes us
  independent from the tkinter version used.
* We are not slowing down the speed of showing new images (= "frames per
  second"). The statistics displayed at end of program can hence be used as a
  performance indicator.

Requires
--------
PySimpleGUI, tkinter

    The upper left and the lower right quad points and the fill color are
    subject to a passed-in parameter. Effectively, they exchange their position,
    thus causing changes to the drawn shape.
    The resulting page picture is passed back as a PNG image and the PDF is
    discarded again. The execution speed of this function mainly determines
    the number of "frames" shown per second.
