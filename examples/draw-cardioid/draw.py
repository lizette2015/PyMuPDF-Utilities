Description
-----------
This script is intended to generate tangent constructors of mathematical curves
like Cardioid, Nephroid and similar. It works by putting the points of a regular
polygon on a circle's perimeter and then draw - in clockwise fashion - a line
from each point to a point following 'curve' places after it.

The number 'curve' determines the type of the constructed curve. For a
cardioid ('curve' = 2) we therefore would be doing this:
Draw lines p0 to p2, p1 to p3, p2 to p4, ..., p[n-1] to p1.

Just change the 'curve' value to create a different curve.
